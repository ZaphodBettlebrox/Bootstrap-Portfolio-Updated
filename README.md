Bootstrap Portfolio:

This is my portfolio project made in Bootstrap with a simple layout. There are three pages; home, contact, and portfolio. Each page has a navigation tool bar located on the top right-hand side with links to each of the three pages. The Contact page has the ability to be filed out, but does not send any information. Lastly on the portfolio page, each one of the images can be clicked and open up a new tab for that exact image selected.
